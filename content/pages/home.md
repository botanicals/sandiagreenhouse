  content: "Sandia Greenhouse has been the leading local grower in Southern Utah
    for over 40+ years. Owned and Operated by Larry Hancock, Sandia specializes
    in local grown plants that thrive in our local climate.   \r

    \r

    Not only do Southern Utahan’s flock to Sandia as their best source of
    bedding plants, vegetables, trees, and  Christmas Poinsettias. But loyal
    customers even come all the way from Nevada, Arizona, and in some cases even
    Central and Northern Utah. \r

    \r

    Many big box stores bring in plants from other climates. This almost
    inevitably results in sub-par growth or the plants dying shortly after
    planting. At Sandia Greenhouse you can count on getting plants that are
    acclimated and ideally suited for our desert climate.  \r

    \r

    So come see us today at 4234 S. Washington Fields Road for your plant
    and growing needs. "
