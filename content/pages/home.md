      content: By far my favorite nursery in the area! I love that they grow from seed
        and not import their fruits and vegetables from other areas. I know what
        I bring home will grow in my garden because it was grown in a similar
        environment. I bought lettuce and spinach and they’re doing great! No
        shock and they’ve been healthy for a few months now. The staff is
        wonderful and friendly as well! Larry knows his stuff! My son lost his
        puppet he had just made and the lady that helped us helped us look for
        it.

      content: This is such a great nursery. Locally owned, and plants that are more
        likely to thrive in this climate than big box stores. People working
        there are also very willing to help with plant selection and ideas.
        Highly recommend shopping here!

      content: I love this place. The owner is so knowledgeable and is always helpful
        and eager to help you with whatever. I hope that his kids take over and
        it never goes away! It is by far the best plant nursery
