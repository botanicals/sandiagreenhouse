  content: "Sandia Greenhouse has been the leading local grower in Southern Utah
    for over 40+ years. Owned and Operated by Larry Hancock, Sandia specializes
    in local grown plants that thrive in our local climate.   \r

    \r

    Not only do Southern Utahan’s flock to Sandia as their best source of
    bedding plants, vegetables, trees, and  Christmas Poinsettias. But loyal
    customers even come all the way from Nevada, Arizona, and in some cases even
    Central and Northern Utah. \r

    \r

    Many big box stores bring in plants from other climates. This almost
    inevitably results in sub-par growth or the plants dying shortly after
    planting. At Sandia Greenhouse you can count on getting plants that are
    acclimated and ideally suited for our desert climate.  \r

    \r

    So come see us today at 4234 S. Washington Fields Road for your plant
    and growing needs. "

      content: By far my favorite nursery in the area! I love that they grow from seed
        and not import their fruits and vegetables from other areas. I know what
        I bring home will grow in my garden because it was grown in a similar
        environment. I bought lettuce and spinach and they’re doing great! No
        shock and they’ve been healthy for a few months now. The staff is
        wonderful and friendly as well! Larry knows his stuff! My son lost his
        puppet he had just made and the lady that helped us helped us look for
        it.

      content: This is such a great nursery. Locally owned, and plants that are more
        likely to thrive in this climate than big box stores. People working
        there are also very willing to help with plant selection and ideas.
        Highly recommend shopping here!

      content: I love this place. The owner is so knowledgeable and is always helpful
        and eager to help you with whatever. I hope that his kids take over and
        it never goes away! It is by far the best plant nursery
