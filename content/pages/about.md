    Sandia Greenhouse has been the leading local grower in Southern Utah for
    over 40+ years. Owned and Operated by Larry Hancock, Sandia specializes in
    local grown plants that thrive in our local climate.\

    \

    Not only do Southern Utahanâ€™s flock to Sandia as their best source of bedding plants, vegetables, trees, and Christmas Poinsettias. But loyal customers even come all the way from Nevada, Arizona, and in some cases even Central and Northern Utah.\

    \

    Many big box stores bring in plants from other climates. This almost inevitably results in sub-par growth or the plants dying shortly after planting. At Sandia Greenhouse you can count on getting plants that are acclimated and ideally suited for our desert climate.\

    \

    So come see us today at 4234 S. Washington Fields Road for your plant and growing needs.
