    *LEARN FROM SANDIAâ€™S  MASTER GARDENERS!*



    Attendees can enjoy hands-on activities and demonstrations at these free gardening events. Our events are also a great way to connect with other gardeners and share knowledge and experiences. So whether you're a beginner or an experienced gardener, these events offer something for everyone!


    Bring your questions, bring your friends and your smiles! Events are typically held outside on own front lawn (weather permitting), so bring a chair, or a blanket. 


    **Be sure to follow us on Facebook for the latest information about our events.**
